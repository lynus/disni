# DiSNI: Direct Storage and Networking Interface

DiSNI is a Java library for direct storage and networking access from userpace. It provides an RDMA interface to access remote memory. DiSNI enables the development of Java applications for high performance RDMA networks, such as InfiniBand, iWARP, or RoCE. The RDMA API is implemented based on the Open Fabrics Enterprise Distribution (OFED) RDMA user libraries. It provides RDMA semantics including asynchronous operations, zero-copy transmission and direct data placement.
